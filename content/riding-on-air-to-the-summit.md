_“Welcome back to the Air Hockey Championships. We’re all tied up with one minute left. It’s Bridgette’s serve.”_

My shaking right hand readies to fire the puck. Do I dare go full force, flinging my wrist right on the edge of the serving line? 

I didn’t get here by playing it safe.

_“Bridgette's hand crosses the line and faults again. It’s Robin’s serve.”_ 

I wipe the sweat dripping off my forehead. My ultra-powerful serve is still too inconsistent.

_“Robin fires off her legendary tornado serve, will Bridgette be able to handle its unpredictable spin?”_

I know better — it’s not unpredictable. She puts it exactly where I can’t reach it. 

With my right hand that is. 

I fling the mallet over to my left hand. I catch it just in time to receive her serve’s blow. I feel the force dig into me, but I brace my legs and rebound it.

I continue to barely keep up with her powerful sends. I glance to my right. 7 seconds.

I take a step back. She sends the puck to my left. I jam my right leg forward, slinging my arm to its full extension. 

I can barely pull off this move while serving at a stand-still. I’ve never been able to pull it off when receiving. 

My hand stops just millimeters before the line as I send it back. Then I hear the buzzer sound.

_“Bridgette scores! Bridgette wins! We have a new champion!”_
