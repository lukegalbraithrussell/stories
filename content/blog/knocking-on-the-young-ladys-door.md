“Good morning, Mr. Broughton.”

“Please, Alice, I insist you call me Henry.”

“I’m afraid that would be most disrespectful of me, Mr. Broughton.”

“Surely not, if I am rightly confident in your response to my most recent parcel.”

“I’m afraid I haven’t had the time to read the mail.”

“Haven’t the time at all?”

“Oh even now, I am behind. The clothes must be washed.”

“Then after.”

“They must be hung.”

“Surely after that.”

“I am picking up bread from the bakery with Ni—Mr. Thatcher.”

“I could escort you instead.”

“I’d hate to trouble you. Now excuse me, Mr. Broughton.”
